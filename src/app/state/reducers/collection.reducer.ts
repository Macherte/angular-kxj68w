 * Definition of a reducer function to manage the state of our book collection.
 * Create reducer is imported from @ngrx/store, its parameters are:
 * @param initialState: the initial state, that needs to be changed according to a dispatched action
 * @param ons: functions that define what to do for each possible dispatchable action. Works like a switch-case block.
